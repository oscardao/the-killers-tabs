Intro:

A5

Verse 1:

A5
Here in the house
Time is sweet
I hear the children playing in the street
Out where the hot winds blow a gentle breeze

Ah-ah-ah

Chorus 1:

C                          Am
I don't need time, I don't need time
    G              F
No, I can get by myself
C                          Am
I don't need time, I don't know why
    G                   E
The summer wind did not tell
  Am                     G
I scrambled online and I know that I
     F
Will never be calm and well
    F                   G
But I can get by in the meantime
     Am
By myself

A5
Woo!

Verse 2:

A5
He's a real winner
Probable to say
Sleeping in the lazy afternoon
A danger to the doubters, they assume

HUH!

Chorus 2:

C                          Am
I don't need time, I don't need time
    G              F
No, I can get by myself
C                          Am
I don't need time, I don't know why
    G                   E
The summer wind did not tell
  Am                     G
I scrambled online and I know that I
     F
Will never be calm and well
    F                   G
But I can get by in the meantime
     Am
By myself

Bridge:

D5                  A5     E5
Deal me a crippling blow
D5                    A5  E5            A5      Am
Steal me  remember my glow, a crippling blow

     F
Will never be calm and well

But I can get by in the meantime
     Am
By myself
     F                    G             Am    Em   Dm  Em  Am  Em
Lord, I can get by in the meantime by myself

Dm                  Em            Am     Em    Dm   Em   Am    Em (fade out)
I can get by in the meantime by myself
