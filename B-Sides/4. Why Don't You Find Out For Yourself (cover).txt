Intro: Em C A A Em C A C

G                   D
The sanest days are mad 
                                Am
Why don't you find out for yourself? 
                      C
Then you'll see the price 
            Em C A A Em C A C
Very closely 

Bm     Em      C
Some men here, 
C           G                Bm       Em
They have a special interest in your career 
           C           D
They wanna help you to grow 
G                        D
And then siphon all your dough 
                              Am
Why don't you find out for yourself? 
                    C                   G
Then you'll see the glass hidden in the grass
G                       D
You'll never believe me so 
                             Am
Why don't you find out for yourself? 
                C
Sick down to my heart 
                                Em C A A Em C A C
Well that's just the way it goes 

Bm    Em      C
Some men here, 
C             G             Bm        Em
They know the full extent of your distress 
     C         D
They kneel and pray 
     G                      D
And they say: "Long may it last" 
                             Am
Why don't you find out for yourself? 
                    C                   G
Then you'll see the glass hidden in the grass
G                  D
Backseats come and go 
D                   Am
For which you must allow 
                C
Sick down to my heart 
                           Em C A A Em C A C G A C D
That's just the way it goes

G                    D
Don't rake up my mistakes 
                         Am
I know exactly what they are 
Am                C
And what do you do? 
C              G
Well, you just sit there 
                         D
I've been stabbed in the back 
              Am
So many, many times 
                  C
I don't have any skin 
                              Em C A A Em C A C G
But that's just the way it goes
